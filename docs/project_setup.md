# Anime Recommender Project: Step-by-Step Guide

## 1. Business Understanding

**Objective**: Define the project objectives and requirements from a business perspective.

- **Define the Project Goal**: 
  - Objective: Create an anime recommender system.
  - Deliverables: A working recommender model, a web application with a backend and frontend.
  
- **Identify Stakeholders**: 
  - Users: Anime enthusiasts looking for personalized recommendations.
  - Stakeholders: Project supervisors, end-users, potentially anime streaming services.
  
- **Determine Success Criteria**:
  - Quantitative: Accuracy of recommendations (measured by user satisfaction surveys or feedback).
  - Qualitative: User experience and engagement.

**Documentation**:
  - Project Charter: Outline project scope, objectives, stakeholders, and success criteria.
  - Problem Statement: Detail the problem you're solving and the business value.

## 2. Data Understanding

**Objective**: Collect and understand the data necessary for your project.

- **Data Collection**:
  - Source: Anime databases like MyAnimeList, AniList, etc.
  - Type: Anime metadata (title, genre, ratings, etc.), user interaction data (ratings, reviews).

- **Data Description**:
  - Describe the data attributes and structure.
  - Summarize key statistics and initial findings.

- **Data Exploration**:
  - Visualize the data to identify patterns and insights.
  - Tools: Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations.

**Documentation**:
  - Data Description Report: Include descriptions, statistics, and initial visualizations.
  - Data Dictionary: Explain each data attribute.

## 3. Data Preparation

**Objective**: Prepare the data for modeling.

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct errors.
  
- **Data Transformation**:
  - Normalize or standardize data if necessary.
  - Convert categorical data to numerical if needed (e.g., genres).

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Create useful features (e.g., genre vectors, user interaction matrices).

**Documentation**:
  - Data Cleaning Report: Document the steps taken to clean the data.
  - Transformation and Feature Engineering Report: Detail the transformations and feature creation process.

## 4. Modeling

**Objective**: Develop and train your recommender model.

- **Model Selection**:
  - Choose cosine similarity for the recommendation engine.
  
- **Model Training**:
  - Train the model on your dataset.

- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Evaluate the model's performance (e.g., using a hold-out test set or cross-validation).
  - Metrics: Precision, recall, or user satisfaction scores from a pilot test.

**Documentation**:
  - Model Selection Justification: Explain why cosine similarity was chosen.
  - Model Training and Evaluation Report: Include code snippets, evaluation metrics, and results.

## 5. Evaluation

**Objective**: Assess the model thoroughly to ensure it meets business objectives.

- **Model Testing**:
  - Conduct thorough testing to validate the model.
  
- **User Testing**:
  - Collect feedback from real users (if possible).

- **Iterate**:
  - Make improvements based on feedback and performance.

**Documentation**:
  - Evaluation Report: Summarize testing results, user feedback, and any iterations made.
  - Final Model Performance: Present the final metrics and why the model is ready for deployment.

## 6. Deployment

**Objective**: Deploy the model and create the web application.

- **Backend Setup**:
  - Use Flask to create a backend server.
  - Implement CORS for cross-origin requests.
  
- **Frontend Setup**:
  - Develop the frontend using Nuxt3.
  - Ensure it interacts with the backend to fetch recommendations.

- **Integration and Testing**:
  - Integrate the backend and frontend.
  - Perform end-to-end testing.

**Documentation**:
  - Deployment Guide: Step-by-step instructions for setting up the backend and frontend.
  - User Guide: Instructions for using the recommender system.

## 7. Documentation and Presentation

**Objective**: Compile comprehensive documentation and prepare for presentation.

- **Project Report**:
  - Include all the above documentation sections.
  - Executive Summary: A brief overview of the project, methods, and results.
  - Conclusion: Summarize findings, challenges faced, and future work.

- **Code Documentation**:
  - Comment your code thoroughly.
  - Provide a README file in your code repository.

- **Presentation**:
  - Prepare slides summarizing the project.
  - Include visualizations, model performance, and a demo of the web application.

## Visualizations to Include

- **Data Exploration**:
  - Distribution of anime ratings, genres, etc.
  - Heatmap of the cosine similarity matrix.
  
- **Model Performance**:
  - Precision-recall curve or other relevant metrics.
  
- **User Interaction**:
  - Screenshots or a live demo of the recommender system in action.

## Example Visualization Code

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example: Visualizing the distribution of anime ratings
anime_data = pd.read_csv('anime_data.csv')
sns.histplot(anime_data['rating'], bins=20)
plt.title('Distribution of Anime Ratings')
plt.xlabel('Rating')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```
